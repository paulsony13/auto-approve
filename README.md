# Auto Approve Environment Deployment

![Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Marketplace-Auto%20Approve%20Environment%20Deployment-brightgreen)  

Easily automate the approval of pending deployments in GitHub Actions when using environment protection rules with multiple dependent jobs.

---

## üìã Problem Statement

When using GitHub Actions with **environment protection rules**, each dependent job in your workflow requires manual approval to proceed. For example, if you have four dependent jobs and environment protection is enabled, GitHub requires manual approval **four times** (or more based on the number of jobs). This defeats the purpose of automation by introducing excessive manual intervention.

### Example Workflow Challenge
- **Job A** ‚Üí Requires manual approval  
- **Job B** ‚Üí Depends on Job A and also requires manual approval  
- **Job C** ‚Üí Depends on Job B and so on...  

If environment protection rules are applied, manual approvals are required at each step.

## üöÄ Solution

This GitHub Action solves the problem by automating the approval process for subsequent jobs once the initial approval is granted. It works by:
1. Retrieving the environment ID of the targeted environment.
2. Auto-approving any pending deployments for that environment, reducing user intervention.

With this Action, you can hook it into any stage of your workflow, and it will auto-approve pending jobs seamlessly.

## üìñ Features

- **Automates Deployment Approvals**: Eliminates the need for repeated manual approvals for protected environments.
- **Customizable Environment Targeting**: Specify the environment name for approvals.
- **Secure API Access**: Leverages a GitHub token to securely interact with the GitHub API.
- **Conditional Execution**: Allows condition-based auto-approvals, such as only for production environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Protection Rules**: Ensure your repository has environments with protection rules configured.
2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Generate a token with `repo` scope to authenticate API calls.
